An apprenticeship is a form of education that combines on-the-job training with classroom instruction.
Apprenticeships are a great way to learn a trade or skill while getting paid.
They are available in a wide range of industries, from construction and manufacturing to healthcare and information technology.

## Why chose an apprenticeship?

When considering your career options, an apprenticeship can be a great choice for a number of reasons.
However, it's important to note that apprenticeships are not for everyone, and they may not be the right fit for every individual.
For many people university is the way to go, as for a lot of people it is the best way to get into their desired career.
However, for some people, an apprenticeship is the best way to get into their desired career.

Apprenticeships offer a number of benefits, including:

In my experience, I chose an apprenticeship because I wanted to gain practical experience in my chosen field while earning a wage,
I didn't want to incur any student debt, and I still wanted to get a degree.
I was also attracted to the idea of learning from experienced professionals and having the opportunity to work on real projects,
instead of working in a classroom all day.
